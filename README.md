# malware-classification

Malware analysis is a vital and challenging task in the ever-changing cyber threat landscape. Traditional signature-based methods cannot keep up with the fast-paced evolution of malware variants. This underscores the need for developing a more effective malware classification tool helping in exploring new research directions with solutions. In this research work firstly, we present a comprehensive assessment on malware classification using dendrogram clustering techniques. This work proposes, a robust approach to malware analysis by constructing dendrogram that groups malware samples which works based on their ancestral relationships. Semantic analysis of the code also provides deeper insights into the malwareâ€™s behavior and functionality, enabling more precise identification. These methods help to detect new variants as well as enhance the recognition of existing malware families. Our proposed model results show that, the robustness in accuracy and False Positive Rate when compared with other existing models.
This repository contains the code and data for research on a robust method for malware analysis. With the help of stacking classifiers used to improve the accuracy of malware detection and dendrogram visualization to represent the hierarchical relationships among malware samples.
